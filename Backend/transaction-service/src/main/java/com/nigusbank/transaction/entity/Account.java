// Account entity removed per user's request.
// The transaction-service will not maintain a JPA Account entity while running in local/demo mode.
// In production, account ids and account data must come from the dedicated Account Service via Eureka + Feign.

// If you later want persistence here again, recreate this entity with appropriate fields.
